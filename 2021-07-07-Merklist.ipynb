    "Using matrix multiplication's associativity and non-commutativity properties provides a natural definition of a cryptographic hash / digest / summary of an ordered list of elements. Due to the non-commutativity property, lists that only differ in element order result in a different summary. Due to the associativity property, arbitrarily divided adjacent sub-lists can be summarized independently and combined to quickly find the summary of their concatenation. This definition provides exactly the properties needed to define a list, and does not impose any unnecessary structure that could cause two equivalent lists to produce different summaries. The name *Merklist* is intended to be reminicent of other hash-based data structures like [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and [Merklix Tree](https://www.deadalnix.me/2016/09/24/introducing-merklix-tree-as-an-unordered-merkle-tree-on-steroid/)."

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition of a hash of a list of elements is pretty simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **list element** is an arbitrary buffer of bytes. Any length, any content. Just bytes.\n",
    "* A **list**, then, is a sequence of such elements.\n",
    "* The **hash of a list element** is the cryptographic hash of its bytes, formatted into a square matrix with byte elements. (More details later.)\n",
    "* The **hash of a list** is reduction by matrix multiplication of the hashes of all the list elements in the same order as they appear in the list.\n",
    "* The **hash of a list with 0 elements** is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction has a couple notable concequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hash of a list with only one item is just the hash of the item itself.\n",
    "* You can calculate the hash of any list concatenated with itself by matrix multiplication of the the hash with itself. This works for single elements as well as arbitrarily long lists.\n",
    "* A list can have multiple copies of the same list item, and swapping them does not affect the list hash. Consider how swapping the first two elements in `[1, 1, 2]` doesn't change it.\n",
    "* Concatenating two lists is accomplished by matrix multiplication of their hashes, in the correct order.\n",
    "* Appending or prepending lists of 0 elements yields the same hash, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets explore this definition in more detail with a simple implementation in python+numpy."

    "### The hash of a list element - `hash_m/1`\n",
    "The function `hash_m/1` takes a buffer of bytes as its first argument, and returns the sha512 hash of the bytes formatted as an 8×8 2-d array of 8-bit unsigned integers with wrapping overflow. **This is the hash of a list element consisting of those bytes.** Based on a shallow wikipedia dive, someone familiar with linear algebra might say it's a [matrix ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_ring), $R_{256}^{8×8}$. Not coincidentally, sha512 outputs 512 bits = 64 bytes = 8 * 8 array of bytes, how convenient. (In fact, that might even be the primary reason why I chose sha512!)"

As a bonus the proof generator and verifier can have totally different tree structures and can still communicate the proof successfully.\n",

This could facilitate verification and sync between database replicas.\n",

You could summarize down to pairs of elements akin to a merkle tree, but you could also summarize a compressed sublist of hundreds or even millions of elements with a single hash. Of course, calculating or verifying a proof of changes to the middle of that sublist would require rehashing the whole sublist, but this turns it from a fixed structure into a tuneable parameter.\n",
